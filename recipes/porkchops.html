    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pork chops bone in or out</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven broiler (or grill) on medium-high heat. Season chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder just before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan or skillet over medium high heat until hot. Sear chops on both sides until golden and cooked through (about 4-5 minutes each side). Transfer to a plate; set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Melt butter in the same pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Saut√© garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water and vinegar. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thickens slightly (about 3-4 minutes), while stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add pork back into the pan, baste generously with the sauce and broil/grill for 1-2 minutes, or until edges are slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.</li>
    </ol>
